# water-storage-model

Contained here is the two-season water storage model with isotopic fluxes. It can be run without any packages. It reproduces the Figure 11 in the manusript "On the seasonality of deuterium excess in non-polar precipitation". Any question about the code can be contacted with the author (zhengyuxia1993@gmail.com).
